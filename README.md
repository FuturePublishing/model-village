model-village
=============

Agricultural code for agricultural people.

Current status - some assembly required.

However, the sheet of paper with the Ikea-style pictograms is conspicuous by its absence.

The model_village module allegedly works.
The etcd module ditto, although it would obviously be much better as a provider-thingy.
Some of the other bits are provided more for entertainment value.


TODO:

Lots of polish.
